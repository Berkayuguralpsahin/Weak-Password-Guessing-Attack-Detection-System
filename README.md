# Weak-Password-Guessing-Attack-Detection-System

This project includes a Weak Password Guessing Attack Detection System designed to encourage users to use strong passwords and enhance security. The project combines a set of features and is designed with advanced coding principles.

Features:
- User Registration and Database: Users are registered and their passwords are securely stored in a database.
- Session Management: Session management is implemented for user login and authentication.
- Password Hashing: User passwords are securely stored by applying hashing techniques.
- Two-Factor Authentication: Users are required to enter a two-factor authentication code during login or for sensitive operations.
- Password Reset: Users can reset their forgotten or desired passwords.
- Login Attempt Limit: A limited number of failed login attempts are allowed before the account is locked for security purposes.
- Logging: System operations and security events are logged in a log file.

This project showcases advanced Python programming skills and follows a security-focused approach. Strong encryption methods and secure coding practices are employed.
